Kate is a extreme light Python algorithmic backtesting framework supporting multiple securities. There are already many similar and excellent backtesting packages and platform using Python. Like RiceQuant' rqalpha, Quantopian' zipline etc. 

Kate's advantage is that it's extremely easy to use and require almost zero learning cost. However, there is always trade-off, that means it might not be very flexible compares to other platforms (though you can always find your way to hack :P)
